# GaiaX Credentials

This project is a fork of [tzprofiles](https://github.com/spruceid/tzprofiles).
GaiaX Credentials (GXC) is a web application that helps users regain control
of their digital identity for use across platforms. It allows users to create
portable verified profiles by demonstrating control over their email addresses,
their public social media and by self-attesting information. These 
verified profiles are then linked to Tezos accounts, allowing any 
platform to resolve and establish trusted information to mitigate 
identity fraud. The [ASC(S e.V.](https://www.asc-s.de/) acts as a
trusted party within the [ENVITED Ecosystem](https://envited.market/ecosystem)
following the vision of facilitating a Open and Distributed Data Ecosystem
(ODDE) for simulation data with the purpose of a virtually enhanced
homologation process.

This project is split into three components. A web app that end-users will
interact with, a worker that will act as a witness, and a smart contract to act
as a registry.
